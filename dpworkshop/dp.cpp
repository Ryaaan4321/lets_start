/*
so dp is  not a recursion bt a optimized recursion 
or you can say not a motherfucker 
bt a optimized & holistic motherfucker
and to solve this problem we have something like 
{level , choice , check , & move};
this is my type of function that i have built with the help 
of vievk gupta to build the inution of the problem 
or to solve the problem of the dp or to model the problem of 
the dp 
lets suppose we have taken stair check problem 
so we will start from the 1st stair and when we start 
we will start from the 1st stair so it can be called as a level 1 
and then after that we will have a choice to choose to go further with tht 
or with the another stair B and once we have taken that we can check that it is valid 
for uss to choose or not becuase she said mein esse jyada bada ni lungi ..
and if the check said (she) yes;
and then move forward

lets suppose we have cells and we have to place queens in the cell in the way 
that not any queen can attack to the other queen

so what can be our level here - cell;
because thats where i m going to place my cell in the matrix

after that we have a choice - and the choice is to 
either place the queen in that cell or not


and after that check is - (cann i place it in that cell if i m placing in that
cell then should check  not any other queenn is attacking on it or i m
not placing the queen in the diagonal or not placing the queen in the
 straight of the any another queen and blaaa and blaaaaa
 )

 and if the check is passed over all the cases than hurrah move forward; 
 thats how simple motherfucker is the dp is;

mja aya kyaaa?
